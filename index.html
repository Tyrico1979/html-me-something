                <p>I was born in Minneapolis, MN. I moved around a lot as a child because my dad was a 
                    Unites States Marine. I went to high school in St. Louis. When I graduated I decided 
                    to attend the University of San Francisco. Afterwards, I moved to Los Angeles to attend
                    acting school. After staying in LA for about a decade, I moved back to St. Louis. This 
                    is where I live now.

                                I was born in Minneapolis on May 6th, 1979. I moved away when I was still a baby. Since then, I've only been 
                                back one time. That was to see my favorite baseball team, The Minnesota Twins, play in their home, Target Field.

                                Part of my travels as a child were to the island of Oahu in the city of Honolulu. This is actually where I 
                                started kindergarten.
